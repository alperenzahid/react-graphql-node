# react-graphql-node practice

## Tech Stack

### Apollo Server, GraphQL, TypeScript

### Jest and Enzyme for Testing
Jest is mainly used for assertion, while Enzyme deals
with testing react component like render components, 
and checking things like props and states.

My personal choice is to place test files 
in the component folder itself.
